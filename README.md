# AI Code Assistant Agent

Welcome to the **AI Code Assistant Agent**, a powerful Streamlit-based application powered by Groq's Llama3 model. This ReAct agent assists users in generating, executing, and visualizing Python code through an interactive Human-in-the-Loop (HIL) workflow. Designed for developers, educators, and data enthusiasts, it supports tasks such as calculations, data analysis, and visualizations, with dynamic conversation management and user feedback integration.

## Features
- **Interactive Code Generation**: Proposes Python code for user approval before execution in a sandboxed environment.
- **Human-in-the-Loop (HIL)**: Displays proposed code for manual review and approval/cancellation via UI buttons.
- **Visualization Support**: Generates line charts from JSON data (e.g., `PLOT_DATA_JSON_START` format) and saves complex plots (e.g., PNG files) using Matplotlib/Seaborn, with download options.
- **Conversation Management**: Supports multiple chat sessions with dynamic naming based on the first user prompt, selectable via a sidebar.
- **Performance Metrics**: Displays total processing time for each task completion.
- **Feedback System**: Allows users to provide üëç/üëé feedback after task completion, with a toast notification confirmation.
- **File Handling**: Detects and processes files created during execution (e.g., CSV, PNG) and offers downloads for generated files.

## Prerequisites
Before running the application, ensure your system meets the following requirements:
- **Operating System**: Windows, macOS, or Linux (tested on Windows 11).
- **Python**: Version 3.11 or higher.
- **Dependencies**:
  - `streamlit`
  - `langchain`
  - `langchain-groq`
  - `python-dotenv`
  - `pandas`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
  - `psutil` (optional, for potential future metrics)

## Installation
Follow these steps to set up the AI Code Assistant locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-code-assistant.git
   cd ai-code-assistant
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment** (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *Note*: Create a `requirements.txt` file with the listed dependencies if not already present.

4. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root.
   - Add your Groq API key:
     ```
     GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
     ```
   - Obtain an API key from [Groq Console](https://console.groq.com/).

5. **Verify Installation**:
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed without errors.
   - Check Python version with `python --version`.

## Usage

### Starting the Application
1. Activate the virtual environment (if used):
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
2. Run the application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run custom_code_agent.py
   ```
3. Open your browser at `http://localhost:8501` to access the UI.

### Examples
- **Simple Calculation**:
  - Input: `Calculate the sum of 1 to 10`
  - Expected Output: Agent proposes a script (e.g., `sum(range(1, 11))`), user approves, and "55" is displayed.

- **Data Visualization**:
  - Input: `Create a line chart with x=[1, 2, 3] and y=[4, 5, 6]`
  - Expected Output: Agent generates JSON data, renders a line chart, and displays it in the UI.

- **File Generation**:
  - Input: `Save a list [1, 2, 3] to a CSV file`
  - Expected Output: Agent creates a CSV file, confirms its creation, and offers a download link.

## Configuration
- **Sidebar Options**:
  - **LLM Model**: Switch between `llama3-70b-8192` (powerful, slower) and `llama3-8b-8192` (faster), applied to new chats.
  - **Temperature**: Adjust from 0.0 (deterministic) to 1.0 (creative) using a slider, applied to new chats.
  - **API Key**: Enter or verify your Groq API key; updates require reinitialization.
  - **New Chat**: Starts a fresh conversation, resetting agent state.
  - **Conversation Selector**: Switch between existing chats by display name.

## Troubleshooting
- **Application Fails to Start**:
  - Check if `GROQ_API_KEY` is set in `.env` and valid.
  - Verify all dependencies are installed (`pip list`).
  - Ensure no port conflicts (default: 8501).

- **No Output from Agent**:
  - Confirm the agent initializes (look for "Failed to initialize Agent" error).
  - Check the Groq API status at [Groq Status Page](https://status.groq.com/).
  - Review the "Agent's Thought Process" expander for logs.

- **Charts Not Displaying**:
  - Ensure `matplotlib` and `seaborn` are installed.
  - Verify the agent outputs valid JSON (e.g., `PLOT_DATA_JSON_START:...`) or file paths.

- **Timeout Errors**:
  - Code execution is limited to 60 seconds. Simplify tasks or check for `input()` usage, which is unsupported.

- **Error Resets**:
  - If an unexpected error occurs, the chat resets to a new session. Retry the prompt.
