In the velvet black of night,
A million stars shine with all their might,
A celestial show, a wondrous sight.
Their twinkling light, a gentle hue,
A soft white glow, that shines anew,
In the darkness, a beacon bright,
Guiding us through, the dark of night.
Oh, starry night, so calm and deep,
A time for dreams, a time to keep,
The magic of the universe, so still,
A beauty that, our hearts can fill.
